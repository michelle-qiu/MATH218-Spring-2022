    "### Homework Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This question will explore the difference between classical Gram-Schmidt (GS) and Modified Gram-Schmidt. We use two matrices, one random matrix generated by you, and a second matrix designed to highlight the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In lab, you wrote code for MGS. Write a similar function for GS. Show a test on a small matrix. You should get the same result as your MGS function.<br><br>\n",
    "1. The *$n\\times n$ Hilbert matrix* has entry $\\frac{1}{i+j-1}$ in the $(i,j)$ position (where $i$ and $j$ are numbered from 1 to $n$). Write a function `hilbert(n)` that returns this matrix. You can use loops if you like. Careful to translate from NumPy (0 to $n-1$) numbering into classical numbering. Show that you get the correct matrix for $n=3$.<br><br>\n",
    "1. GS and MGS produce orthogonal matrices. If $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix, what is $Q^TQ$?\n",
    "> We will test how good our functions are by testing how far away from the desired result our actual result is. To do this, we will take our result, $Q$, subtract $Q^TQ$ from the matrix we 'should' get (the answer to Part 3 of this question), and find the *matrix norm* of the result. The matrix norm is simply the square root of the sum of the entries of the matrix, and can be computed using `np.linalg.norm(A)`. Call this number the *error*.\n",
    "1. Generate a random $200\\times 200$ matrix using `np.random.rand(200,200)`. Compute the errors we get using each of GS and MGS.<br><br>\n",
    "1. Consider the matrix `0.00001*np.eye(n)+hilbert(n)`. Compute the errors for this matrix using each of GS and MGS.<br><br>\n",
    "1. Comment briefly on the results in the previous two parts of this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While a complete error analysis is beyond the scope of this class, see [here](https://www.math.uci.edu/~ttrogdon/105A/html/Lecture23.html) if you're interested in why MGS is so much better."

    "### Homework Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose at least one of the following to extend your handwriting recognition work. Doing both well will get extra credit. If you do both, you will have created a handwritten digit recognition system that is as good as can be given only the tools we have.\n",

    "#### Extending your code to compute binary classifiers for all ten digits\n",
    "1. Compute binary classifiers for each of the digits between 0 and 9.<br><br>\n",
    "1. Compute error rates for each digit, both on the training set and the test set.<br><br>\n",
    "1. For each image in the test set, use all ten classifiers to see how many handwritten digits your classifiers give unique answers to. That is, if your classifiers determine that a particular image may be a 1 or a 2, then you cannot classify that particular image. How many images were not recognized as any digit at all?<br><br>\n",
    "1. Compute your overall success rate on the test images. That is, compute how many images were correctly and uniquely classified. Also compute the rate of *false positives* (that is, images that were identified as digits, but whose label was wrong), and *false negatives* (images whose digit couldn't be assigned). This is how good your handwriting recognition is!\n"
