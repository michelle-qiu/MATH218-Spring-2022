    "\n",
    "Look back at your hand-computed row-reduction from Homework Question 2. For each entry in the row-reduced augemented matrix, write down how many *significant figures* you'd need to write out each number in full. For example, the number 101 requires three significant figures, whereas 100 requires only one, since it can be written as $1e+02$ (i.e. $1\\times 10^2$). Likewise, 100.001 ($1.00001e+02$) requires six, as does 0.000100001 ($1.00001e-4$).\n",

    "\n",
    "As you saw in Homework Question 2, it is possible to construct relatively simple examples where the limit is exceeded, resulting in very incorrect results that do not round correctly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because floats in Python can only hold a certain number of digits and remain accurate, when two digits that are very disparate (like more than 15 significant digits apart from one another) are added together, the least significant one is rendered irrelevant and is assumed to be zero. We can see how this worked in the matrix above, because a very large number was added to a very small number, and this caused errors when we were using our code to reduce the matrix for the above reasons."
