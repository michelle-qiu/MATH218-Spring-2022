    "The first printed statement demonstrates what happens with a dot product between a row vector and a column vector; this results in a single value because the multiplication of vectors with $1\\times 3$ and $3\\times 1$ dimensions respectively will create a matrix of size $1\\times 1$. The second statement shows how the dot product between a $1\\times 3$ row vector and a $3\\times 3$ matrix prints out a row vector of dimensions $1\\times 3$. The third statement shows the dot product between a $3\\times 3$ matrix and a $3\\times 1$ column vector, and how it creates a column vector of dimensions $1\\times 3$. The fourth statement demonstrates the dot product between two $3\\times 3$ matrices that results in another $3\\times 3$ matrix. The fifth statement  is essentially creating a row vector by multiplying each column in $A$ by every value in column vector $v$ and summing these columns together to create a single row vector. Finally, the sixth statement basically does the same thing as the third statement; it takes every row of $A$ and makes the dot product between these rows and column vector $v$ each value in the final column vector."

    "Each of the first three print statements demonstrate how to take the dot product between matrices $A$ and $B$. The first print statement is the simplest way to get the dot product of these matrices by directly multiplying them. The second print statement demonstrates how we can compute the dot product between $A$ and each individual column of $B$ in order to get a matrix whose rows are the columns of the dot product of $A$ and $B$. By transposing this matrix, we receive the same result as the first print statement because swapping the $(i,j)$ value for the $(j,i)$ value essentially just makes each row into a column and vice versa. Similarly, the third print statement demonstrates the exact same idea, except it explicitly states the process for finding each value of the resulting matrix, by multiplying individual values in $B$ by each column in $A$ (making the final matrix a linear combination using values in matrix $B$ as the weights multiplied against matrix $A$). The final print statement shows how we can extract a single value from a matrix; if we want to retrieve the second row, third column, we can compute a dot product using the second row of $A$ and the third column of $B$ to find this value."

    "I selected William Molineux and analyzed his role in the Revolutionary War. Although he was clearly one of the war's most prominent participants, with 154 connections within the network of rebels, he was not nearly as recognizable as some of the other members on this list. Upon doing some research, I found that the reason for this was that he had actually died before the Revolutionary War had even begun. Due to this, as well as his revolutionary ideas that were considered radical for the time by some of his colleagues, he is largely unmentioned for his contributions in history. However, by leading boycotts and large demonstrations against the Townshend Acts, and even by becoming one of the organizers of the Boston Tea Party, he certainly did not play an insignificant role in the rising tension between Great Britain and the American colonies that spilled over into war.\n",
