    "\n",
    "To sum up the columns of an array *A*, use the command `A.sum(axis=0)`. Likewise, to sum rows, use `A.sum(axis=1)`. Since NumPy arrays are row-by-row, axis zero enumerates the *rows*. That is, it is the *vertical* axis (this may be a little confusing! Make sure you re-read and understand it!). Position zero along axis zero is is the first row, and so on. Likewise, position zero along axis one is the first column.\n",

The axis numbers in these commands (zero and one for 2-D arrays) refer to the *axis* that NumPy *collapses*. That is, `A.sum(axis=0)` collapses all the rows together by summing them together, giving a list of sums of each column. It adds *vertically*, along the zero axis. Likewise `A.sum(axis=1)` adds *horizontally*, along the one axis.\n",
    "\n",

If we use the same syntax, but give an array of logical (boolean) conditions instead of `1:3` or `[1,2]`, we can extract columns according to a condition: \n",
    "* Try `A[:,[True, True, False, True, False]]`. What happens?\n",

    "We check if a number is even by checking if its remainder when divided by two is zero: *a* is even if `a % 2 == 0` returns `True`. \n",

    "\n",

    "The easiest (and often, least efficient) way to modify arrays is element-by-element. This is straightforward: `A[1,2] = 4` changes the number in the second row, third column of the array *A* to be *4*. If you want to add a number to an array element, subtract from it, multiply it, or divide it, use inplace syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A[1,2] += 2 # Add two\n",
    "A[1,2] -= 2 # Subtract two\n",
    "A[1,2] *= 2 # Multiply by two\n",
    "A[1,2] /= 2 # Divide by two (Caution! See section on floats below)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying Whole Rows or Columns\n",
    "There are two important ways to modify rows and columns. Since rows and columns are 1-D arrays, we can add a 1-D array of the same size. For example, if *A* is a $5\\times 4$ array, the following work:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v = np.array([1,3,4,0])\n",
    "w = np.array([0,2,5,2,4])\n",
    "A[2] += v\n",
    "A[:,1] += w\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can also do element-by-element multiplication and division:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A[2] *= np.array([1,2,3,4]) # This mutiplies the first element of the row by one, the second by two, etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "NumPy also supports modifying entire rows or columns at once, for example by adding the same number to all elements in a row:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A[1] += 2 # This adds two to every element in the second row of v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of *broadcasting*, which we will examine in a more general case below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying More General Slices\n",
    "Similarly to the above, if we have an $m\\times n$ slice of an array, we can either add/subtract/multiply/divide it to/by a single number, or we can add/subtract/multiply/divide its elements to/by an identically shaped array. Also see below for modifying such slices by broadcasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 12** Starting from a $6\\times 4$ array of ones, carry out the following operations in order:\n",
    "* Insert the number seven in the third row, fourth column;\n",
    "* Add two to every number in the second column;\n",
    "* Subtract three from every number in the fourth row;\n",
    "* Consider the $3\\times 3$ slice whose top-left corner is *A[1,1]* and whose bottom-right corner is *A[3,3]*. Multiply these entries by multiples of two, starting from zero and ending at 16. (Hint: Use the `arange` and `reshape` commands.)\n",
