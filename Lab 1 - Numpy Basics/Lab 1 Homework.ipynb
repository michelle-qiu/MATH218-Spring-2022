    "# Homework Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework in this class will largely constitute answers written into Jupyter notebooks, like this one. You will be expected to hand in homework assignments with your partner. All homework must be done with a partner - individual assignments will not be accepted. The name of the homework notebook submitted should contain the names of all students who worked on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work on homework with others in the class, but are expected to hand in your own work. Specifically, any submitted code and text must be your own, written by you and your partner.  Copying and modifying code found either online or from a colleague will constitute plagiarism and will be treated as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit homework, use Sakai. Each assignment will have a space for submission under the Assignments section of the Sakai site for this class. You may submit a Jupyter workbook and any additional materials required. To download a copy of this notebook, use **File menu -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)** after renaming this worksheet.  All files submitted should be named with all partners' names. Each assignment will have a deadline. Late work will not be accepted without explicit permission from your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "All your text should be in Markdown (see a reference [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)). Mathematical notation should be typeset in LaTeX. If you double click on this box, you can see how to typeset 1-D arrays. By double clicking in various boxes in the lab, you can see how to typeset 2-D arrays and other useful notation. You should research basic LaTeX as needed online, or ask your teacher or TA. We'll be more than glad to help! \n",
    "\n",
    "You may insert as many code and text boxes as you need in these homework sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "All your code should be clearly commented, including references to the question you are answering. If your instructor needs to dig through the questions and your answers to understand what you are doing, your grade will be lower. All your code should be executable by your instructor. If a block of code gives errors, your grade will be lowered. Variables with meaning should have sensible names.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a letter grade and brief comments on each of your assignments. In general, your grade and comments will be identical to your partners'. This class will not have a final or tests. Your grade will be based on homework. The class is not curved: you will be graded on your own work, not in comparison to others.\n",
